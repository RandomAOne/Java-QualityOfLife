some simple methods to clear screen, round values to nearest integer, wait etc...

## =current features=
(NOTE: More features will be added over time)


**round(double, int)** -> rounds a given number to the nearest multiple of the Integer given

**clear()** -> clears the screen when called.

**in(Object s)** -> No need to write those terrible line for creating a scanner object, just write `in("_Message_").next_DataType_(); // in("Message10").nextLine();`

**print() and println()** -> inspired by @TONYflare123, python-like print statements.
