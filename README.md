(NOTE: More features will be added over time)
round(double, int) -> rounds a given number to the nearest multiple of integer given
clear() -> clears the screen
in(Object s) -> No need to write those terrible line for creating a scanner object, just write in("<Message>").next<DataType>(); // in("Message10").nextLine();
print() and println() -> inspired by @FlareX, python-like print statements
